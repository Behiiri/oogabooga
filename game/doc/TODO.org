* Quests
** TODO add health to player character
** TODO add xp
** DONE add kill count
** TODO add weapon pickups
** TODO add skills
** TODO add win and lose conditions
** TODO increase moster HP and show damage numbers

* Bounties
** INVALID after using special bullet, the range change gets applied to normal bullets too.
I think this has nothing to do with special bullets
** TODO tank bullets apply damage more than once (each frame that it collides with a monster)
I can have a list of bullets or monsters that collide and ignore them when checking for collision,
but this feels so unnecessary and inefficient
bullets can have a list of monsters
or monsters can have a list of bullets
what is the alternative?
** FIXED pickups collide with bullets
bullets was checking all entities, now they just check monsters
** TODO repositioning monster can put monsters on a position that needs repositioning again
so sometimes the repositioning can happen more then 10 times for a monster
** FIXED tank bullet can miss on obb, even when two sprites clearly overlap
I forgot to apply scale for sprites, now it works OK.
